keycloak proviodes role based access to authenticated users. 

keycloak gives two types of tokens. 
1- for the user accounts to be logged in
2- a token for the access through api links. not everyone  can connect through the api's.

another use from keycloak:-
OpenID Connect protocol: is also implemented with keycloak. 
so openidconnect is used by google, facebook or keycloak to authenticate the same user.
 while SSO also does the same thing but the underlying working is different

keycloak supports both SSO and openidconnect

how it works:-
*) it validates the credentials and issues a JWT token. then this token is used with each request.
*) if a person has a session key, another person canno get the access to the server.

concepts of keycloak:-
*) realm
*) clients
